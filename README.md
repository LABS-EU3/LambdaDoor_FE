# LamdaDoor

Many atimes Job seekers find it difficult getting information specific to their search with respect to companies' interview processes, cultures and salary information that are less generalized, hence they spend alot of time searching and filtering what's needed from the sea of available information.

LambdaDoor is here to make that search simpler by providing stream lined information that are specific to companies and regions, even providing connections to previous job seekers that have intervied or work(ed) with these firms.
